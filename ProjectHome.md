This project uses jacobi method to compute steady heat-transfer problems in parallel ways like MPI with CPUs, CUDA with GPU.

Jacobi method is a simple way to solve steady heat-transfer problems. Also it is easy to improve into a parallel jacobi method to be runned on cluster or GPUs. this project is to try jacobi method on Cluster by MPI and on GPU by CUDA. It is hoped to get hundreds speed-up.
